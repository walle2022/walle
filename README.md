  `` WALL-E is the result of two semesters worth of work by four students here at the University of Delaware. The nature of a senior design is one that is very open ended. Each group decides how much time and effort to put into it. Our team started putting hours of effort each week into our project in the fall and we kept going ever since. We are proud of the challenges we overcame along the way to create our robot. ``

  `` Our inspiration for this concept came from the movie itself. WALL-E is a Pixar animation film that is set in a post-apocalyptic setting, where humankind attempted to reduce the amount of pollution but created robots that compacted the trash into cubes. The earth was eventually populated with too much garbage (in the form of cubes), so they decided to grab a selection of humans onto a spacecraft where they would live. WALL-E is the main character of the film; he is a robot that continues his job of compacting trash but is also shown developing emotion and interests. WALL-E finds enjoyment in taking care of his cockroach pet (also is concerned when he gets crushed) and finds interest in old 60â€™s films, such as Hello, Dolly! ``

 `` The team was fascinated by the idea of designing a realistic WALL-E. The goal is to design the robot described in the film: one that can compact trash, have emotions, and interact with the people and things around it. With virtual assistants becoming increasingly common, we wanted to bring personality to the market by bringing WALL-E to the table: a comprehensive desk assistant bot. The objective is to design a robot similar to the one described in the film: one that can interact with the people and objects around it and have emotions. ``
